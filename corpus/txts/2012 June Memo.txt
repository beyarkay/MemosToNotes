ii. <class 'str'’>
iii. <class 'int'>

iv. <class float'’>
C

(d) The expression "nausicaa"[1:7:3] will evaluate as:Question 7 [10]

(a) Convert the decimal number 42 to binary, showing your working. [2]
42/2 = 21 rem 0
21/2 = 10 rem 1
10/2 = 5 rem 0
5/2 =2 rem 1
2/2 = 1 rem 0
1/2 = 0 rem I answer: 101010

(b) Convert the octal number 312 to hexadecimal, showing your working. [2]
011|001|010 = 0|1100|1010
answer: CA

(c) Calculate 12 - 2 using 8-bit 1’s complement binary representation, showing all your working.
(i.e. convert the numbers to 8-bit 1’s complement before adding). Leave your final answer in 1's
complement form. 3]

00001100 — 00000010

= 00001100 + 1s(00000010)
= 00001100 + 11111101

= 00001011 carry 1

= 00001011 + 1

= 00001010

 

(d) Find the value represented by the floating point number written below using TEEE754
tepresentation (bias of 127 added to the exponent; first bit is the sign bit, next 8 bits are the
biased exponent, rightmost 23 bits are the significand). Show all your working. B]

1 10000000 01100000000000000000000
sign implies negative value

biased exponent is 128 so actual exponent is 128 — 127 = 1
mantissa is 1.011 in binary which is 1(.125+.25) =1.375 in decimal
so number is - 1.375 * 281 =- 2.75

11Question 8 [20]
The Event Manager

As a young student at UCT, you have discovered numerous extra-curricular activities that you
would like to participate in. However, it is difficult to keep track of the many events taking place
around campus. You have therefore decided to store a list of events in a text file, with multiple
programs to update the file and search through the file.

The “data.txt” text file will have the following format:

seminar, What's at the bottom of the sea,Spongebob Squarepants,2012-05-08, 16:00, 17:00

movie,My favourite colour: Blue,Papa Smurf,2012-05-08,18:00,20:00

debate, Who is the fairest of them all,The seven dwarves,2012-05-12,18:00, 19:00

 

The add.py program, to add entries to the file, is listed below:

details = input ("Enter new event details:")

key = ",".join ((details.split (",")) [3:5]) # line 2
f = open ("data.txt™", "r")

data = f.readlines({)

f.close ()

position = 0
filekey = ",".join ((data[position].split (",™)) [3:5])
while position<len(data) and filekey<key:
positiont=1
if position<len(data):
filekey = ",".join ((data[position].split (",™)) [3:5])

data.insert (position, details+"\n") # line 14
f = open ("data.txt", "w")
for line in data:
print (line, file=f, end="")
f.close ()

(a) Explain in simple English what the purpose of line 2 of add.py is. [2]

The date and time are extracted from the new details [1] and concatenated into a single
string [1]

(b) In line 14 of add.py, an extra newline is added to the new entry. Explain why. [2]

all existing entries already have newlines and newlines are not printed when the file is
updated so the newline has to be added beforehand[2]

(c) If we are counting comparisons, what is the best case time complexity (order) of the add.py
program? What is its worse case time complexity? [1]

OO”) [1]; Oy) [1]

12(d) When defining equivalance classes based on the size of the existing file, at what boundary value
does add.py not work? Explain why. [2]

empty file [1]
the program tries to access data at position 0 without checking if it exists [1]

Will add.py still work if it is in Day-Month-Year

(e) The date is in Year-Month-Day format.
[2]

format? Explain your answer.
No. The comparison of dates will fail because days will be considered first so a difference in
days will be more significant than a difference in months or years. [2]

(f) Write a program to ask the user for a date, read in the entire file and print out all matching
entries. Ignore the time values. [8]

details = input ("Enter date:") [1]
f = open ("data.txt", "r") [3]
data = f-readlines()
f-close ()
for entry in data: [4]

key = (entry.split (","))[3]

if key==details:

print (entry,end="")

(g) Describe a more efficient algorithm than reading in the entire file in the previous question. [2]

Read in one line at a time [1] and stop after the date becomes larger than the date being
searched for (or we reach end of the file). [1]

13ii, ‘asc’
iii, ‘nsa'

iv. ‘aia

A
(ce) 4>3 or 'happy' and 'sad' will evaluate as:
i, True
ii, "happy'
iii. 'sad’

iv. TypeErrorQuestion 2 [7]

(a) Explain clearly and concisely the difference between machine languages and high-level
languages and the purpose of an interpreter. [4]

The language understood by a computer is called a machine language. It is in binary.[1]
High level languages use recognisable words and are more easily understood by humans.
They are portable. [1] An interpreter is a complex program that translates [1] a program
written in a high-level language[1] into immediately executable machine code [1].

(b) Python has two basic numeric data types. What are they called and why is it it necessary to
have two separate types for numbers? B]

int and float[1] Integer and floating point arithmetic is handled differently in the hardware.
[1] Integer arithmetic is faster and therefore it makes sense to use the integer arithmetic
when possible. [1]Question 3 [18]
Examine the module listed below:
def bob(s):
m=0
c= wt
for x ins:
tally=s.count (x)
if tally>m:
m=tally
c=x
print (c,m)

bob ("totoro")

bob ("cat")
bob qm)

(a) From the module listed above, give an example of:

i. a variable [1]

Any of the variables used in the program: x, tally etc.

ii. a literal [1]

Any of the strings (“totoro”, etc) used in the program

iii. a string function [1]
count
iv. a relational operator [1]
>
(b) Explain, in general terms, what the function bob does. [2]

It searches through a string to find the highest frequency character and outputs the number

of times it occurs

(c) Write down the exact output of this module when it is run in the Python interpreter (i.e. when
you press “Run” in the Wing IDE). [6]

t...0...3
c...1
0(d) The function bob uses a definite loop. Rewrite the function so that it behaves exactly the same,
but uses an indefinite loop. B]

def bob(s):
m=0
c="!
while s: #one for this while line

x=s[0] #one for setting the initial loop counter
tally=s.count(x)
s=s[1:] #1 for reducing the string length
if tally<=m: continue
m=tally
c=x
print(c,end="...")
print(m)

(e) When called with a string (like “lolololololo”), the algorithm in function bob is not very
efficient. Explain why this is and suggest how you could improve the algorithm. B]
With a string like “lololololololo”, the function bob will call the count function once for

every time a letter is repeated. One improvement could be to use the replace function to
remove a character from the string once it is counted.Question 4 [20]
Student travel poll

Varsity newspaper has hired you to perform a poll of the students on campus, to find out how
students travel to campus. Someone has claimed that Science students use the Jammie Shuttle more
than students in Arts, Engineering, Commerce or Law, and Varsity would like you to check whether
this is true. Varsity would also like to report on what percentage of the whole student body travels
by Jammie Shuttle, car, train, on foot or by other means. You have decided to write a simple Python
program to assist you in this task of collecting data from students.

(a) Do you think that a sentinel loop would be a good idea for this program? Justify your answer,
explaining the concept ofa sentinel loop. 3]

Yes. [1] A sentinel loop is an indefinte loop that continues until a certain “sentinel” value
(non-data) is entered [1]. This loop would be useful as you don't know how many students
you will interview.[1]

(b) Write the Python code for your application. You do not need to do extensive error checking in
this code — just write the basic algorithm and assume that the input data will always be correct.
[12]

#There are a number of correct answers, of course
#could use lists/dictionaries also
S_JS,c.f-J,t,0=0,0,0,0,0,0 #1 for intializing counters
total=0

faculty= input("Science faculty? (y/n)")

while faculty:
travel=input("Travel by car(c),foot(f), Jammie Shuttle(j), train(t) or other (0)?") #1
if travel=='c':
ct+=1
elif travel =={f':
fr=l
elif travel ==]j':
Jt+=1
if faculty=='y':
S JS+=1
elif travel =='t':
tt=]
elif travel == 'o':
o+=]
total+=1
faculty= input("Science faculty? (y/n)")print(J=', J/total*100, 'c=',c/total*100, 't=',t/total *100, f=" f/total*100, 'o=',0/total*100)
print(‘Science J=', S_JS/total*100) #4 suitable output

(c) Varsity now wants to write a fun article on the most and least common birth dates on campus.
Can you reuse the same algorithm/approach that you employed in your solution above, or
would you need to change your approach? Justify your answer. 3]

The answer depends, obviously, on which algorithm they used The one above would not be
suitable, as the elif ladder would be very tedious to write for birthdates. An
array/dictionary would then be a better plan.

(d) Varsity now also wants to commission an online dating service and would like you to write the
code that will match potential partners. You go to your lecturer for advice and she says that,
from a Computer Science point of view, it would be a very bad idea to do this. Explain her
reasons, clearly and briefly. [2]

For this code you will need a clear algorithm. However, there is not really an algorithm for
dating that has been proven to work.Question 5 [10]

Tic-Tac-Toe (aka Noughts and Crosses) is a game where 2 players, assigned the symbols X and O,
take turns to place their symbols on a 3x3 grid, with the winner defined as the first player to create a
horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of 3 symbols.

The following is a typical game board after 4 turns:

 

(a) Write a set of Python statements to create a 3x3 2-dimensional array of “” (space) characters in
the variable grid. [3]

grid = [] ... [1]
for i in range(3): ... [1]
grid.append ([''] * 3) ... [1]

(b) Write a function checkBoard (grid) that returns the symbol of the winner or “” (space) if
the board is still incomplete. |

def checkBoard (grid):
for r in range (0, 3): [2]
if grid[r][0]==grid[r] [1]==grid[r] [2]:
return grid[r] [0]
if grid[0][r]==grid[1][r]==grid[2][r]: [2]
return grid[0][r]
if grid[0][0]==grid[1][1]==grid[2][2] or grid[1][1]==grid[0][2]==grid[2][0]: [2]
return grid[1][1]
return '' [1]Question 6 [10]

As a holiday job, you have been assigned the task of stock control in your mum's spaza shop. Being
a typical computer science student, you first entered the stock number of each item into a program.
Each time a product is ordered, you have to search for the item. You have decided that it is more
efficient to use a binary search but you first need to sort the list in ascending order.

The list of items is as follows:
PEEP PEPE

(a) Show how the quicksort algorithm can be applied to this list to sort the items in ascending order.
Show each step of the algorithm. Use the last item as the pivot. Clearly indicate the list(s) and
the pivot at each step (using [] around a list and () around a pivot). [4]

[3275 (8) 121113]
[32(5)7]8[ 12 1 (13)]
[(2)3]5 [7] 8 [A 12] 13
2 [3] 578 11 [12] 13
23578111213

(b) Your mum thinks that you are wasting your time and should instead just use a linear search.
Explain, using known information about the efficiency of each algorithm, why your solution is
faster, even for only 8 items. [2]

Each time linear search is O(n); sorting first is O(n log n) and then each binary search is
O(log n)[1]. for many search operations, the searching takes much more time than the
sorting, so the second approach is faster [1].

(c) Write a recursive function to check if an item is in an unsorted list. Your function must return 0
ifthe item is not found and 1 if it is found. [4]

def linsearch (item, itemlist):
def linsearch (item, itemlist):

if len(itemlist)==0: [1]
return 0
elif itemlist[0]==item: [1]
return 1
else:
return linsearch (item, itemlist{1:]) [2]
