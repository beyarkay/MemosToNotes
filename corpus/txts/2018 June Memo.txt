You are working in a holiday job for an academic publisher. They have asked you to
correct manuscripts to conform to a particular style. As a first task, they want you to
ensure that all numbers less than ten are written as the word and not the digits in all
manuscripts. For example ‘nine’, not ‘9’; ‘eight’, not ‘8’ and so on. You are finding the
search-and-replace task very tedious, and so want to write a Python function to automate
this. As all the manuscripts are plain text files, your function correct_text will read
in the text from a file (whose name provided to the function) and write out the text with
all the digits corrected to another file (whose name is also provided to the function). The
correct_text function should print a helpful message if the input file does not exist.

For example, if the function is called as follows:

correct_text (“input .txt”, "output .txt”)
and the file “input.txt” contains the following text:

On the fifth day of Christmas

my true love sent to me:

5 Golden Rings

4 Calling Birds

3 French Hens

2 Turtle Doves

and 1 Partridge in a Pear Tree

the output file will then be written as:
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me:
five Golden Rings
four Calling Birds
three French Hens
two Turtle Doves

and one Partridge in a Pear Tree

However, if the file “input.txt” does not exist, this message will be displayed instead:
File input.txt does not exist!

Now complete the correct_text function on the following page.def correct_text (input_file_name, output_file_name):Answer: #there are correct alternatives
def correct_text(input_file_name,output_file_name):

try:
#open file for reading
inp=open(input_file_name, 'r') #[1]
allText=inp.read() #[1]

inp.close() #[0.5]

#4 marks for some correct way to replace the words
for word in swaps: #[1]
textList=allText. split(word) #[1]
allText=swaps[word] join(textList) #{1]

# writing out to file correctly
out=open(output_file_name, 'w') #[ 1]
print(allText, file=out) #[0.5]
out.close() #[0.5]

compile and run the following code?
x = [1, 2, 3]
print ("Value is:", x[1])

a. The program has a syntax error
because the syntax [1, 2, 3] is wrong
and it should be replaced by {1, 2, 3}.

b. The program has a syntax error
because the [1, 2, 3] is wrong and it
should be replaced by [0,1, 2, 3].

c. The program has a syntax error
because the [1, 2, 3] is wrong and it
should be replaced by [1.0, 2.0, 3.0].

d. The program compiles and runs fine
and the output "Value is 1" is printed.

e. The program compiles and runs fine
and the output "Value is 2" is printed.
