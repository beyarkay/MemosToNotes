11Question 5 [10]
Alternate Statistics

At the end of the semester, the Computer Science department compares CSC1015 marks to those
for previous years to check for quality, trends in performance, etc. Such comparisons can be made
on the basis of simple statistics, like the pass rate or the average mark. These statistics are
sometimes controversial, as they do not fully capture the performance of a highly varied class of
students.

As one candidate for an alternate statistic, the department would like to also calculate the average of
the lowest 5 marks.

Write a Python program where the user can input an unsorted list of marks, at the end of which the
program will output the average of the lowest 5 marks. The user must enter marks one at a time,
ending with a value of -1.

Your program must work for any number of marks from 1-1000. Assume that there are no errors
during input and do not round/truncate your answer when printing out the result.

Examples:
+ Ifthe user enters the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, and 2, the output value is 3.0.

+ Ifthe user enters the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 2, the output value is 2.5.
