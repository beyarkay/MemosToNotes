y = ord(s[i].lower({))

for j in range((y - ord('a')) + 1):

if (i41) % 2 ==
x += (it1)
else:
x += s[i]
return x

EOne correct answer is:
fin = False #{2]

filename = 'exam_q4_input.txt'

while not fin: # [12]

try: # [2]
dataFile = open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8')
data = dataFile.readlines()
dataFile.close()
fin = True # [2]

except IOError: # [72]
filename = input("enter a new file:") # [74]

return data

(e) Why is the process data function not written as follows? [1]
def process (inData):

for line in inData:
line = line.replace('\n', '')

line = line.split(',')

 

 

 

 

This function does not actually change the data inside inData but rather the line variable
instead. [1]

11Question 5 [10]
Examine the Python code below and answer the questions that follow.
def riddle(n):
if n<=0:
return 0
a=1
b=1
for i in range(n-2):
a,b=atb,a
return a

(a) You are asked to test the riddle function using a range of testing strategies.

a. Which would be better, random testing or exhaustive testing? Explain your answer. [1]

 

 

 

 

b. Write down a minimal set of inputs to this function that would constitute a complete
statement test. [1]

 

 

Two values required: any integer>=2, an integer <=0

c. Write down a minimal set of inputs to this function that would constitute a complete
path test. [1]

 

 

‘Three values required: An integer >=2, an integer <=0, 1 or 2

(b) Rewrite the riddle function below to use recursion instead of iteration. [4]
def riddle rec(n):

 

 

 

 

 

 

12def riddle_rec(n):
ifn<=0: return 0 #{1]
ifn==1 or n==2:
return I #[1]
return riddle_rec(n-1)+riddle_rec(n-2) #[2]

(c) Calculate 719-1710 using 8-bit 2's complement binary addition. Show all calculations. [3]

 

 

 

 

710-1710

= 00000111 + 2's complement (0010001) [1]
=00000111 + 11101110{1]

=11101111 [1]

13Question 6 [10]

The generation of complex computer graphics requires a lot of mathematical calculation, sometimes
including trigonometic functions like sine. This can be very slow, because trigonometric functions
are inherently slow to compute. To speed this up, we can use a mechanism called a cache, where
we temporarily store recent answers so we can reuse them without recalculating them.

Your task is to write a function, as defined below, to serve as a cache.
sine_cache (x, cache)
@ x - the value to calculate the sine of.

® cache - an array/list of at most 10 items that stores previous values. Each entry in the cache
is of the form /x, sine_x, time], where sine_x is the sine value forx and time is when the
value was last calculated.

Your function must first check if x exists in the cache. If it does, the associated sine_x value must be
returned. Ifx does not exist, invoke the function math.sin(x) and return this value, but also store
these values in an empty position in the array. If the cache array already has 10 items, replace the
entry with the lowest time value.

When storing entries into the cache, you can get the current time as a number of seconds using the
function time() from the time library.

You MAY NOT use a dictionary or any other data structure for the cache. [10]

Examine the exam _Q4.py module listed on the last sheet of the exam and the input file
exam _Q4 input.txt and answer the following questions.

(a) Write down the exact output when this module is executed (e.g., when the user presses the
“Run” button in Wing101)? [2]

 

 

 

 

none [1]
None [1]

(b) Rewrite the process and search functions so that they create and use a Dictionary instead
of a List. [3]

def process(inData, dictData):

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

def search(dictData):

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

One correct answer is:
def process(inData, dictData):
for i in range(len(inData)):inDataf{i] = inDatafi].replace(‘\n', ")
inDataf{i] = inDataf{i].split(’, ')
dictData[inData[i][0]] = inDatafij][1] — #{1]

def search(dictData, term):
if term in dictData: #[1]

return dictData[term] #[1]

(c) What is the advantage of using a dictionary instead of a list for this problem? [1]

 

 

 

 

Searching for an item associated with a particular key is much faster for a dictionary
(O(1)) than an unordered list (O(n)) [1]

(d) Rewrite the load function so that it handles the situation where exam_Q4 input.txt
does not exist. by asking the user for a new file name and loading that file instead. This should
repeat until a valid file is loaded. [3]
