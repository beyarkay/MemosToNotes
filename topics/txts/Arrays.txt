8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN EProblem: Basic statistics program

Write a program to output the average, a, the median,
x, and the standard deviation, s, of a series of test
values typed in by the user.
The median is the middle value in a list of values.
The standard deviation is a measure of how
spread-out the data is and is calculated using this
fomula:

 

standard deviation: a quantity expressing by how much the members of a
group differ from the mean value for the group.

list individually.

oWhen you do need to know the indices use -
for n in range (len (X)):
print(n, X[n])

Each item in an list could itself be a list.

oO For example:
xX = [[1,2], [3,4] ]

2-D arrays/lists are equivalent to matrices or grids.

O All operations work just as before, but every item is
now a list.

oO To access an item, remember that X[0] will give us a
list, so X[O][0] gives us the item in position (0,0) of the
grid.

bottom-left is 6.

 

 

 

 

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWNn-Dimensional Arrays

Lists can easily contain more than 2 dimensions.
oO For example a 3-d structure can be:

= X=[ [[1,2],[3,4]], [[5,6],[7,8]], [[9,10].[[11,12]]]

m X(1][1][O]= ?
Suppose we want to store a list of students, with a list of
courses for each student, and a list of test dates for
each course, and a list of chapters per test, we could
use the following 4-d list:

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWNDictionaries

Instead of a sequence with indices, Python also has a
data structure with arbitrary index values and no order -
this is called a dictionary.

oO A dictionary is a set of key=value pairs.

oO Dictionaries are very efficient for storing/retrieving
values and mapping one list to another.

Oo Define as follows:
= D={'a':'apples'’, 'b':'bananas’, 'p':'pears'}

his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped
quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,
though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty
dust from entering along with him.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWNGeneric structures

oO Every data structure is generic. So just as it is
possible to have n-dimensional lists, you can have
dictionaries of lists, list of dictionaries, etc.

D = {'kayleigh':[12,23,31],
"callum':[45,54,55]}

E = [{'name':'palesa','year':1},

{'name':'luqmaan', 'year':1}]

oO Passing arrays to functions
In Python, the values of actual parameters cannot be changed
in a function.
= Arrays cannot be replaced.
HOWEVER, the contents of arrays can be changed.
= This is a way of passing back multiple values from a function

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Ememinaer: Variadie ocope and
lifetime

Not all variables are accessible from all parts of our
program, and not all variables exist for the same amount of
time.

Where a variable is accessible and how long it exists depend

on how it is defined.
the part of a program where a variable is accessible or modifiable
called its scope
the duration for which the variable exists is its lifetime.

formal parameters can also only be seen inside the function

even if they have the same name

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN 38 EReminder: Scope

A variable which is defined in the main body of a file is called a global

variable.

It will be visible throughout the file, and also inside any file which
imports that file.

A variable which is defined inside a function is local to that function.
It is accessible from the point at which it is defined until the end of
the function, and exists for as long as the function is executing.
The parameter names in the function definition behave like local

variables
but they contain the values that we pass into the function when we call
it.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN 39 EReminder: Global variables

O global / nonlocal

= Python parameters can be declared as global in a function
to indicate that the variable being used is actually declared
outside any functions (not recommended)

= nonlocal can be used similarly for nested functions.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWNConcept: Arrays

An array is an indexed sequence of values associated
with one variable.

Array values: | 5 2 7|1/83

index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

 

oO Arrays can be fixed length or variable length.

oO Arrays can hold multiple values of the same type or
different types.
