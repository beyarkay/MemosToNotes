8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN numero Indorum Computer Science EE.Programming in Assembler

oWrite program in text editor.

oSave program in file.

oAssemble source code into object/machine code.
mtasm hello.asm

oOptionally link multiple files together and create
executable understood by OS.

mtlink hello.obj
oExecute application in OS.

mhello.exe

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Pros/Cons of Assembler

oPros

uMatched machine code so can do whatever CPU can
do.

=Very fast execution of programs.

=Can be used on obscure CPUs.

oCons

=Difficult to program.

=Programs are very long.

=Programming is slow process and prone to errors.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.High Level Languages

OHigh level languages are easier for humans to
understand.

oWe need to convert programs in high level languages
to low level languages so computers can understand.

o2 common approaches:

aCompile
ulnterpret

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Compilers (C++)

    
       
    

#include <iostream>

Compiler command:

using namespace std;
g++ -o test test.cpp

int main ()

        

cout << "Hello World";

return 0;
C++ Program Source Code
Machine Code

 

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Interpreters (Python)

olnterpreter reads each statement and executes an
equivalent set of machine code instructions.
oCompared to compiled programs:

mEasier to program - no compile step.

=™Programs run slower - source code must be processed
every time.

Interpreter command:
python3 test.py

   
 

print ("Hello World")

Python Program Source Code

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Types of High Level Languages

oProcedural/Imperative, Object-oriented - programs are
specified as exact sets of instructions to execute.

aPython, Java, C++

oDeclarative/Logic - programs are rules and facts that
are processed by an engine.

=Prolog, XSLT

OoFunctional - programs are collections of functions that
are applied and composed to solve problems.

=Haskell, Lisp

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Alan Turing (1912-1954)

oFather of Computer Science
oMajor contributions:

=Defined what can be called an algorithm
and showed the universality of algorithms.
aChurch-Turing thesis

=Defined a Universal Computer

oTuring Machine

=Defined how we test for Al

aTuring Test

=Part of WWII code-breaking team that deciphered Enigma messages.
oHarassed by UK govt because he was gay

=committed suicide in 1954.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.What does the CPU understand?

oOMachine Code is the only language a CPU
understands directly!

oEach instruction is a sequence of numbers.

oOOn x86 CPUs, instructions have variable lengths.
=™some are 2 numbers, some 3 numbers, etc.

oFor example:

=180 76 = store value of 76 in special CPU variable AH
=205 33 = call OS function (if AH=76, this means quit)

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.The Operating System

oManages resources on computer.
oExecutes on startup (boot):

=BIOS ROM has instructions to load OS - fixed in
hardware!

=Disks are checked in order defined by hardware.

ulf OS machine code is on a disk, load it into memor
and start execution. .
=OS takes over and allows users
to select and run their programs
until computer is shut down.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Low Level Languages

oOMachine Code is a low level language.

mONLY language CPU can understand.

=Different MC for every CPU!

oLow level languages are easier for a machine to
understand, and often difficult for a human.

oAssembly language expresses machine code symbolically
- so humans can write programs more easily.

oOExample (quit a program):

mdecimal: 108 76 205 33

mhexadecimal: B4 4C CD 21

massembler: MOV AH,4Ch
