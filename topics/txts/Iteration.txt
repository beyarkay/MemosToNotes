Problem 1 Introduction

@ Output the 7x table for each of the
values 1-12.

What is Iteration?

@ Executing the same basic task or set of
statements multiple times.
@e.g., print the 7x table (from 1 to 12)

@ Allows repetition in a program without
having to type out the same
statements multiple times.

2 Also enables variation with each
repetition

Analogies

Condition-controlled Loops

@ If we do not know the number of iterations a
priori (in advance), we can use a condition-
controlled (or event-controlled) loop
@ Where the loop executes while a condition is

true.

@ Syntax:
while <condition>:

<statement1>
<statement2>

“while” Example

sum 0
num eval(input() )
while num != 0:
sum = sum + num
num = eval(input() )

print(sum)

Problem 6

@ Approximate the logarithm (with a
base of 10) of an integer using
repeated division.

Poll: Loop Equivalence

@ Which of the following loops end with the same
value of fac:
a) fac=1
for i in range(1, n+l):
fac *= i
fac = 1
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
fac = fac * i Ho) and b)
an a a) and c)
while i <=n: BB AI of them
fac *= i HB None of them

i=l

Problem 7

@ Approximate the logarithm (with a
base of 10) of an integer using
repeated division.

@ Design a user interface where the user
can continue to ask for logarithms until
the user enters a value of 0.

Problem 8

@ Create an interactive menu to select
and print out sandwich ingredients.

 

Page 13Interactive Computer Graphics 20 Feb 2006

Menus

@A menu is a list of choices presented to
the user, with the means to select one.
Example:

Souper Sandwich Menu

1. Chicken, cheese and chilli sauce

2. Chicken and chili

3. Chicken

4. Exit Program

Enter the sandwich number:

Menu Example

choice = eval (input ("Enter choice: "))
# get selection
while choice!=4: # continue until exited
print("Add chicken") # print ingredients
if choice<3:
print("Add cheese")
if choice<2:
print ("Add chili")
print() # leave a line
choice = eval(input("Enter choice: "))
# get selection again

Post-check loop

@ When the “loop body” is going to be
executed at least once, we should check
the condition after the loop (instead of
before).

@ No statement in Python for this. Can we do
still do ite

Problem 9

@Find the reverse of an integer.

@For example, the reverse of the integer
12345 is 54321 and the reverse of 98 is
89. Use only integer manipulations - do
not convert the number to a string.

Other Loopy Techniques

@ Infinite loops
@break
@continue
@else
@pass

Infinite Loops

@A loop where the condition is always
true
@This is offen an error

@Example:
while True:
print(”“Wheeee!”)

 

Page 16Interactive Computer Graphics 20 Feb 2006

@ Exits immediately from a loop
2@Best to avoid if possible
@Example:
i=0
while True:
it=1
print(i)
if i == 10:
break

continue

@Immediately starts next iteration
@Example:
for i in range(10):
if (i 3 3 == 0):
continue

print(i)

 

Page 17Interactive Computer Graphics 20 Feb 2006

else

@ Execute at end of loop that ends
normally (not break)

@Example:
for i in range(10):
print(i)
else:
print("done" )

@Do nothing
@Example:
for i in range (10):
if (i % 3 == 0):
pass

else:
print(i)

Selecting Loops

@When you know the number of
iterations
@use a counter-controlled or definite loop
such as “for”
@When the iterations depend on a
condition

@use a conditional of indefinite loop such
as “while”

Converting Loops

@How do we write the equivalent of
@"while” using “for?
2 “for” using “while”?

Problem 10

@Write a program to calculate the
value of Sin(x) for any real value of x.
Use the infinite Taylor series
approximation:

ep 2p gi
sin (x) @ 2 — 3 | SI

@ Extend your program to draw a
Sin(x) graph using ASCII art.

Counter-controlled Loops

@Counter-controlled loops execute for a
fixed number of times.

@A special counter variable is assigned
a different value each time and may
be referred to within the loop.

@Python provides the “for” statement as
a counter-controlled loop.

The “for” statement

In general

for <variable> in <something that creates a sequence>:
<statement1>
<statement2>

Typical form

for <variable> in range (<start>, <stop>, [<step>]):
<statement1>
<statement2>

Example
for x in range (1,10):

The range function

range is a special function that generates a list of
integers.

Three different forms:

range(stop)

2 begins at 0; ends just before stop; increments by 1
each time

range(start, stop)

2 begins at start; ends just before stop; increments by 1
each time

range(start, stop, step)

@ begins at start; ends just before stop; increments by
step each time

The range function

@Examples:
@range(10)
2 [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
@range(5,12)
2@[5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
@range(3,9,2)
2 [3, 5, 7]
@range(8,1,-1)
2 [8,7,6,5,4,3,2]

Problem 1 Solution

for n in range (1, 13):
print (n,"x 7 =",(n*7))

@Output:
1x7=
2x72
3 x7==

General Semantics of “for”

Flowchart vs Python

for nin range (1, 13):
print (n,"x 7 =",(n*7))

Problem 2

@ Output the n x table for any
integer value of n.

 

Page 6Interactive Computer Graphics 20 Feb 2006

Problem 2 Solution

 

n = eval (input("Enter the multiple: "))

for i in range (1,13):

print (i,"x",n,"=", (n*i))

Problem 3

@Find the product of the integers from
ln
@This is the same as calculating n!.

 

Page 7Interactive Computer Graphics 20 Feb 2006

Problem 4
@ Calculate a® using a for loop,

assuming that a is a float and b is an
integer.

Problem 5 Introduction

@Write programs to generate (on the
screen) the following triangles of user-
specified height:

*
kkk
kkk
kkkekekkk

 

Page 8Interactive Computer Graphics

Nesting of statements

@ for and if are both statements, therefore they can
each appear within the statement body.
for i in range(10):
if i>b:

max = i

if a<b:

for i in range(10):

for i in range(10):

for j in range(10):

Nested loops

@ Where a task is carried out multiple times
and a subtask within that is carried out
multiple times.

@ Example:

@ Draw a rectangle of arbitrary height/width on
the screen, such as (height=4, width=3):
KK

KK
KK
