8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Parts of a Modern Computer 2/2

oCentral Processing Unit (CPU): microchip that performs core computation. It
usually contains the ALU and CU.

oMemory (primary storage): microchips that store data which can be accessed while
computer is switched on.

=Random Access Memory (RAM) is volatile and modifiable.

=uRead-Only Memory (ROM) cannot be changed.

OHard drive, Floppy drive (secondary storage): store data on magnetic discs
permanently i.e., the data is not lost when the computer is switched off.
olnput/Output devices: transfers data from operator to machine and vice versa.

oOperating System: software system that manages resources on computer and
executes application programs, e.g., Windows XP, Ubuntu Linux.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer ScienceEarly Calculation 1/2

Early Chinese abacus can be used to add,
subtract, multiply and divide.

 

 

* 8 @ 2 F 2 S£ #@ GF @

Mechanical calculators invented by
Schickard, Pascal, Leibniz, etc. used
cogs and wheel to compute.

 

Slide rules performed
multiplication and division using

logarithms — in popular use until
about 1970.

= Computer Science EE.Early Calculation 2/2

In early 1800s, Jacquard used punched
cards to control a loom.

 

Hollerith used punched cards for the
1890 US census (his company
eventually became |IBM!).

 

Babbage’s difference engine (1830)
calculated tables of polynomial
values.

 

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Analogue Computing

Babbage designed (but never built) the first general-
purpose programmable computer — the analytical

engine.

Vannevar Bush (1930) built
a differential analyzer that
used wheels/discs to
perform integration.

 

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Vacuum Tubes

ENIAC (1946) was one of
many early programmable
digital computers, using
vacuum tubes for
computation and patch
cables for manual
programming.

 

 

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.1960s to Present

First transistors and integrated circuits and finally
microprocessors, revolutionised computing, made them
small, cheaper and more general-purpose.

oHardware refers to the physical parts of the
computer.

=Hardware is sometimes referred to as computer
components and peripherals.

mE.g., Motherboard, Hard Disk/Drive

oSoftware refers to the set(s) of instructions given to
the computer to execute one or more tasks.

aSoftware is sometimes referred to as programs.
mE.g., Microsoft Office, Firefox

oThis describes how a conceptual computing
device works:
=Memory stores data and instructions.

Control Unit (CU) obtains and executes
instructions.

nArithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) does calculations.
Accumulator is internal ALU storage for some data.
=lnput is process of getting data into machine.
