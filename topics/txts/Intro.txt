February 2019What is Computer ScienceAlgorithm: Take Minibus Taxi to Town

1.Make sure you have enough money
2.Wait at bus stop

3.Flag down taxi as it approaches
4.Get into taxi (somehow)

5.Collect fare from behind you, add your money and pass it
forward

6.Shout at driver to stop

7.When taxi stops, prod other passengers to make them move
out

8.Get out of taxi
9.Give thanks for a safe trip!

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Can we be more precise?

oLet us make up a precise drawing language (inspired
by Turtle/Logo).

OSuppose we have an invisible box 10cm square, and
we start at the bottom left corner, facing up.

oOWe have 2 instructions:
=Draw <centimetres>
oDraw a line

mSpin <degrees>

oTurn to the right T

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Drawing Example

oDraw 10cm
oOSpin 90
oDraw 10cm
oOSpin 90
oDraw 10cm
oOSpin 90
oDraw 10cm

 

 

 

 

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Drawing Exercise 1

oWhat does this draw?

oSpin 90
oDraw 10cm
oOSpin 180
oDraw 10cm
oSpin 90
oDraw 10cm
oSpin 90

¥ Draw 10cm
UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Drawing Exercise 2 (1/3)

oThis exercise is a 2-person task.

oPerson A will be the algorithm designer (aka the
programmer).

oPerson B will be the algorithm implementer (aka the
computer).

DAt first everyone is Person A - then Person B.

oOSome pairs of volunteers will do the task up-front
where the roles are distinct.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Drawing Exercise 2 (2/3)

oPerson A: Write down instructions (in our special
language) to draw this shape.

onYou have 2 minutes!

 

 

 

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Drawing Exercise 2 (3/3)

OSwap your instructions with someone else.

oOPerson B: Draw this shape using Person A's
instructions.

onYou have 2 minutes!

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Programs

oA program is a set of instructions given to a computer, corresponding to an
algorithm to solve a problem.

=The act of writing a program is called programming.

oPrograms are written in a precise language called a programming language.

oSample Program (in Python):

letters = [32, 85, 67, 84]
for a in [70364627997701, 4329864565765, 4329327694853,

4329864565765, 4329505817940]:

while a>0:
print (chr(letters[a & 3]),end="")

a=ap>>2

print ()

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Question

OHow is an algorithm different from a program?

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Process of Programming

oOPrograms work as follows:

=lngest information from the real world (input).
=Process data internally.

aSend computed data back to real world (output).

oBecause of different input, each time a program
executes the results can be different.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.What is Computer Science?

oComputer Science (CS) is the study of:
=Computer software

=Algorithms, abstractions and efficiency
= Theoretical foundation for computation

oWhat you learn in Computer Science:

=Principles of computation

=How to make machines perform complex tasks

=How to program a computer

=aWhat current technology exists and how to use it
Problem ‘solving vu Computer Science REFPython

oThere are many different types of computer
languages, and many different languages.

oThis course is based on Python.

oPython is a general-purpose interpreted programming
language invented in the 1980s/1990s by Guido van
Rossum at CWI.

oWe use version 3 because it is easier to learn.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.How We Program in Python

oWe write programs, stored in text files.

oEach program is a set of instructions that the Python
interpreter will execute when the program is executed by
the user.

oOWe often do both of these things in an Integrated
Development Environment (IDE).

oOWe can also use the interactive interpreter to run short
programs while testing our ideas.

oLater, we will neaten our code into blocks called functions.
oPython is an OOP language but we will not use this.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Problem Solving in CS 1/2

1.Understand the problem

1.What are the knowns and unknowns?

2.Plan how to solve the problem

1.What algorithm is used to solve the problem?
2.What assumptions are being made?

3.Is this similar to other problems?

4.Can the problem be split into parts?

3.Carry out your plan — write program

1.Write program(s) to implement algorithm(s).

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Problem Solving in CS 2/2

4.Assess the result

1.Does the program conform to the algorithm?
2.Does the program/algorithm solve the problem?
3.ls the program correct for all cases?

5.Describe what you have learnt

1.... $0 you do not make the same mistakes again.
6.Document the solution

1.Write a report for users of the program.

2.Write comments within the program.

BB vnwvensiry oF CAPREMFErence: Vickers, P. 2008. How to think like a programifem€Ceniage. FEAlgorithms

OAn algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a task.

oEveryday tasks require algorithms but we usually do
not think about them.

mE.g., putting on shoes, brushing teeth

oAlgorithms must be precise so that they are
=Repeatable

mHave a predictable outcome

=™Can be executed by different people

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Algorithm: Read a Novel

1.Acquire book

2.Find comfortable spot to sit

3.Open book to set of facing pages

4.\f there are no more unread pages, go to step 8
5.Read facing pages

6.Turn page over

7.Go to step 4

8.Close book

9.Be happy

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Elements of Algorithms

oSequence

mEach step is followed by another step
oSelection

=A choice may be made among alternatives
olteration

=A set of steps may be repeated

oAny language with these 3 constructs can express any
classical algorithm.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Classic Problems / Algorithms

oOTake the minibus taxi to town

oPut on a pair of shoes

oBake a cake
