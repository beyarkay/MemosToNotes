(thanks to Hussein Suleman <hussein@ cs.uct.ac.za>)Problem 1 Introduction
oWrite a program to print out the reverse of a sentence.

oFor example:
=Computer becomes retupmoC

oUse first principles - i.e., process the string character-
by-character.

oUse functions to make your program
readable/modular.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Pass-By-Value

oOnly a copy of the value of a parameter is ever sent to
a function.

OSo if there is an original variable, it cannot be changed
by the function changing the parameter.

def some_function (a):

a=atl

print (a) 13
12

b = 12
some_function (b)

print (b)

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.scope and Local Variables 1/2

oNew variables can be created and used within
functions but they disappear when the function ends.

acalled local variables

def some_function ():

a= 1

print (a) 1

some_function ()

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.scope and Local Variables 2/2

oLocal variables names (and parameters) that are the
same as global variable names temporarily hide the
global variables.

def some_function (a,c):

a= 1
b= 2
some_function (1,2)
print (a,b)

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Global Variables

oOGlobal variables can be accessed but not changed.

oUse the global statement to allow changes to a global
variable.

def some_function (a):

global b
b= 4
a= 3

some_function (b)
print (b)

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Return Values

oFunctions can return values just like mathematical
functions.

oUse the return statement with an expression.

oOCan be used anywhere in function and will return
immediately.

def square (x):

return x*x

y = square (12) | opt 144

print (y)

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Problem 1
oWrite a program to print out the reverse of a sentence.

oFor example:
=Computer becomes retupmoC

oUse first principles - i.e., process the string character-
by-character.

oUse functions to make your program
readable/modular.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Sciencedocstring

OoFunctions should be documented by specifying their
purpose in a string immediately after the header.

olt is recommended that you use """ (triple quotes - for
multi-line strings) for all docstrings.

oUse func.__doc___to check the docstring.

def cube (x):
"""Return the cube of x.""™"
return x*x*x

def square (x):

"""Return the square of x.
x can be any numerical value"""

return x*x
8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.nested functions

oOFunctions can be composed similarly to mathematical
functions.
def cube (x):

return x*x*x

def square (x):

return x*x

def power (a, b):

return a**b

print (power (cube (2), square (2)))

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.main function

oOCommon practice is to wrap a program into a function
called "main", then invoke this function to execute the
program.

# Cube program

def cube (x):

return x*x*x

def main ():

print (cube (2))

main ()

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Writing your own modules

oAny file with functions can be imported.
oCheck name _ variable

aif itis" _main__", then this file was executed
sotherwise, this file was imported

cube module # test cube module
def cube (x):
return x*x*x import a
def main ():
print (cube (2)) print (a.cube(3))
if _ name__=="__ main __":

main ()

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Function

nA function is a named block of statements that can be
executed/called within a program.

oWe have already used some functions:
Mprint, eval, round,

oPython stops what it is doing, runs the function, then
continues from where it stopped.

oFunctions enable reuse and modularity of code.

oFunctions help us to write longer/more complex
programs.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Problem 2

oConvert the freewifi program to use functions, with all
the best practices for using functions.

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Problem 3 Intro 1/2

oWrite an application to tell what country or body of
water the International Space Station is over right now.
Use best practices for functions.

Oo

oExtend your application to give the next time the ISS
will fly over South Africa

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Problem 3 Intro 2/2

ohitp://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json Will give the
current latitude and longitude of the InternationalSpace

Station

ohitp:/Awww.geonames.org/export/web-
services.html#countrycode Can help us find a country
name from a latitude and longitude

ohitp:/Awww.geonames.org/export/web-
services.html#ocean Can help us find the ocean name
from a latitude and longitude

Oo

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.International Space Station

OF irst component launched
| in 1998

OModular space station
oLargest man-made body
in orbit

oOCan often be seen with
the naked eye from Earth
oScience!

 

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Default values for parameters

oFunctions can have zero or more parameter with default values
in their definition.

DAIl parameters with default values must be at the end of the
parameter list

me.g., once you have a default value, all subsequent parameters
must have a default value as well.

oEvaluated at the time of function definition, not invocation

oWhenever the function is called/invoked, the arguments with
default values are optional.

OWithin the fn body, parameters still used as variables.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Recall: Formal Parameters

def some_function (a, b, c):

print (a)
print (btc) formal parameters
some_function (12, 23, 34)

xX actual parameters

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science [eeDefault values for formal parameters

def some_function (a, b, c=10):

print (a)
formal parameter
print (b+tc) with default value

some_function (12, 23, 34)

some_function (12, 23) optional parameter

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Problem 3

oWrite an application to tell what country or body of
water the International Space Station is over right now.
Use best practices for functions.

oO

oExtend your application to give the next time the ISS
will fly over South Africa

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.So far:

# reverse an integer without using strings
number = eval (input (“Enter a number: "))
reverse = 0
while number > 0:

digit = number % 10

number = int(number / 10)

reverse = reverse * 10 + digit
print (reverse)

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Function - example

# somewhere else

passes control def input (someString):

   
 
 
 
  
  

# reverse #tunction to read from standard input
returns contro

number .

reverse =U def eval (aStringNumber):

while number > 0:
digit = number % 10 def int(aString or aFloat):
number Cint(n} ber / 10)

#returns an integer using floor function
averse = reverse * 10 + digit
(orig reverse) def print(oneOrMoreStrings):

#outputs the strings to standard output

#converts string to number

Computer Science EE.Function Definition / Use

oFunctions can be defined and used in any order, as
long as they are used after definition.

OTo define a function:
def some_function ():
statementl

statement2

oOTo use/call/invoke a function:

some_function ()

B UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Code refactoring

oFunctions can refactor code to avoid duplication

S KkNito: chet Gv 3 " ) Computer Science EE.Parameters

oEvery function can have a list of parameters in its
definition.

acalled the formal parameters

oOWhenever the function is called/invoked a value must
be provided for each of the formal parameters

=called the actual parameters or arguments

oWithin the function body, the parameters can be used
like variables.

8 UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Computer Science EE.Formal and Actual Parameters

def some_function (a, b, c):
