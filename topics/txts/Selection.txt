Problem 1 Introduction

@Write a program to calculate the
minimum of 4 integers without using the
min/max/math functions. Use a
sequence ot if statements.

What is Selection?

@ Making choices in the flow of
execution of a program.

@e.g,., if it is a leap year then there are 29

days in February — otherwise there are
28

TEE

 

 

I EEE

Analogies

@Like a detour off a
road

@Or a siding switch
on a railroad track

@The different roads
or tracks represent
different execution

paths, eventually
rejoining

Booleans Revisited

@ boolean - stores only True or False
values.
@e.g., i like _CSC1015 = True

if i like CSC1015:
i_eat_weetbix = True

Boolean operators

 

Boolean Meaning
Algebra

AND true if both operands are true

 

 

OR true if at least one operand is
true

true if operand is false;
false if operand is true

Operator precedence

@Now that we have seen how operators
can be mixed, we need precedence
rules for all operators
@() (highest precedence — performed first)

@ **K

@*///%

Q+-

@< <=>=>==/=

@ not

and

2 or (lowest precedence — performed last)

Boolean operator example

in_classroom = False
is raining = True

if (in_classroom and is raining):
print (“Lucky!”)

if (not in_classroom and is raining):
print (“Wet and miserable!”)

if (not is raining and not in classroom) :
print (“Happy!”)

Reversing expressions

@ Use not operator to reverse meaning of boolean
expression, €.g.,

if mark >= 0:
# do nothing
else:

print (“Error”)
@ Instead, invert the condition
if not (mark >= 0):

print (“Error”)

@ Can we do better 2

Boolean expression example

marks =

if marks >= 75:
symbol = ‘1’

(marks >= 70 and marks < 75):
symbol = ‘2+’

(marks < 0 or marks > 100):
symbol = ‘XxX’
print (“Invalid mark!”)

Poll: Boolean Expressions

@ Which of the following Boolean expressions are
equivalent:

a)a >= banda<c

b) not a < b and not a >=c

c) not(a < b and a >= c)

Wc) andb)

HE ob) andc}

HH Allof them
HB None of them

Problem 5

@Write a program to calculate the
minimum of 4 integers without using the
min/max/math functions. Use if
statements with boolean expressions.

Problem 6

@Write a program to check the login
name and password for an online
system such as Vula. Your program
must assume a set of 3 valid users and
check only for those users, outputting
an appropriate message in either case.

Problem 7

@Write a program to determine the
ingredients in a sandwich based on the
sandwich number.

 

Page 15Interactive Computer Graphics 20 Feb 2006

Problem 8

@Write a program to perform a
selectable standard operation (+-/*) on
a pair of numbers depending on an
operation specified as an input value of

either ‘a’, 'm’, 's' or'd’.

@For example, if the numbers are
entered as 3 and 5 and the operation is
entered as 'm’, the result should be 15.

 

Page 16Interactive Computer Graphics 20 Feb 2006

Conditional expressions

@Selections are made on the basis of
expressions that must evaluate to True
or False (boolean).

@ Relational operators always return
boolean values, €.g.:
@ answer > 1.0
@ number_of people <= 14
@month == 12 # note: not the same as “=”
@date != 13 # not equal
@money >= 5000

The “if” statement
if boolean_expression:
statementl

statement2

else:
statementa
statementb

@ Statements must be indented to same level to be
considered part of the same block.

@ Python will usually execute all statements within a
block once it starts on a block.

Example usage

if month == 12:

print ("Hoorah! No classes")
else:

print

Another example

if year < 2000:
fear_factor

else:
fear_factor

if fear_factor ==

print (“be afraid — be very afraid”)
else:

print (“it’s OK! no Y2K bug!”)

Shortcut

@No else part.

if number_of_ students > 250:
print (“Full!”)

 

 

 

Poll: If Statements

@ What is the output of the following python code:
num = 0
print(“Jab “, end=‘’)
if num >= 0:
print(“ber “, end=’’)
else:
print(“woc “, end=‘’)
print(“ky”)
HB Jab ber woc ky
HE sab woc ky
HE jab ber ky

HB Jab ky

Problem 1

@Write a program to calculate the
minimum of 4 integers without using the
min/max/math functions. Use a
sequence ot if statements.

Problem 2 Introduction

@Write a program to calculate the
minimum of 4 integers without using the
min/max/math functions. Use nested if
statements.

 

Page 6Interactive Computer Graphics

Nested “if” statement

password = input ("Enter your password")
if password==real_password:
if name=="admin”:
logged_in = True
else:
print ("Error")

Dangling Else

@ Python can always determine which “if” an
“else” belongs to because they have the same
indent level.

password = input ("Enter password:")
if password==real_ password:
if name==“admin”:
logged_in = true
else:
print (“Error”)

@ In other programming languages, this is called
the dangling else problem. Python does not
have this problem.

Multiway selection

@ Multiple conditions, each of which causes a different
block of statements to execute.

@ Can be used where there are more than 2 options.

if conditionl:
statements ...
else:
if condition2:
statements ...
else:
if condition3:
statements ...
else:

“if” ladder

@ Just a nicer way to write multiway
selection.

if operation == ‘a’:
answer = first + second

elif operation == ‘s’:
answer = first - second

elif operation == ‘m’:
answer = first * second

Problem 2

@Write a program to calculate the
minimum of 4 integers without using the
Math methods. Use nested if
statements.

Problem 3

@Write a program to sort 3 integers and
output the sorted order symbolically.
@For example, if the numbers are {n1=3,
n3=6, N3=5}, then the sorted order is “n1-n3-
n2”.

@Use nested if statements.

Problem 4

@Write a program to calculate your final
grade and symbol in CSC1015F based
on marks for theory tests, exam,
practicals and practical tests. This must
include the possibility of DPR.

Problem 5 Introduction

@Write a program to calculate the
minimum of 4 integers without using the
min/max/math functions. Use if
statements with boolean expressions.
